                Suprisingly, this is an album I rarely use as I don't find much places to bust down an epic move out of nowhere. Therefore, this is 
                a playlist that would either reside in my room or in the shower. I don't trust myself to listen to these songs in my car as I may end up 
                in a ditch after banging my head to some Pitbull or taking my hands off the wheel to dance Usher or Rihanna. Overall, try this playlist when the classics
                are needed to be felt again. Once they start playing Jason Derulo at the clubs again, let me know. <br>
