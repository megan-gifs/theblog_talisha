                A pure example of me failing to find reason with what exactly a playlist should be used for. As someone who enjoys daydreaming on a trip back
                home on BART, I always listen to r&b and indie music as a way to meditate, sit back, and relax. What's the point of going home on public transit
                if I can't stare out the window and use my imagination. Many artists always tell their fans that listening to music is one of the best ways to feed 
                creativity. Which is why I have a dedicated playlist to music that allows me to study, think, nod my head to the beat, probably get distracted from how 
                awesome the song is, and continue with my work. <br>
