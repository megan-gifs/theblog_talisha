                I had curated this playlist over a few minutes after finding mismatched Japanese rock songs all over my liked songs. 
                I had realized I really enjoyed this genre of Japanese rock specifically called "Math rock" I always find it interesting how 
                a genre of music can connect to a school subject. I enjoy the rapid guitar strums and class drum beats that keep the heart going.
                This is the playlist I recommend for a summer day walking down San Francisco. Keep in mind as the city's weather is chaotic, weird,
                and not very nice-- this playlist can still be played in even the rainiest of days. It's just another reason to keep your hopes up 
                and possibly brighten your day.<br>
